# [WIP| eurofox

Work in progress - this ain't working yet, folks.

Firefox plugin to automatically translate Â° Fahrenheit and size measurements into european units.

The source is very heavily inspired by the [tc](https://github.com/spb/tc) firefox extension.

To check if the installation works in your browser, navigate to the [test page](testpage/test.html).

## TODOs
