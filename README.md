# Eurofox ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡º ðŸ”¥ ðŸ¦Š

Firefox plugin to automatically translate Â° Fahrenheit and size measurements into european units.
To see the original value, hover over the measurement.


Before:
![Without the plugin](./images/no-plugin.png "Without the plugin")

After:
![With the plugin](./images/yes-plugin.png "With the plugin")


The numbers are rounded for easier reading, so don't expect exact values.
The plugin will not work for values which are spelled out as words instead of numbers (such as `one mile` instead of `1 mile`).

The source is inspired by the [tc](https://github.com/spb/tc) firefox extension.

To check if the installation works in your browser, please navigate to the [test page](demo/test.html).

## Supported units:

* Temperature (Fahrenheit to Celsius)
* Sizes (inch, foot, yard, miles)
* Areas (acres)
* Speeds (mph, knots)
* Liquids (barrel, gallon)

## TODOs

* WIP DOM mutation observer
* BUG: multiple edge cases on the test page
* replace numbers like `3.0` with `3` and remove all `.0` from tests
* add missing unit tests
* add github actions for unit tests and protect main branch
* convert units for cooking (pint, cup, quart, various spoons and ounces)
* maybe replace jquery with pure js
* make logo?
* make ESLint more strict
* remove console output
* turn into JS module
* clean up screenshots and highlight translation
* publish
* add options to exclude domains

## Notes for development

* Regexes:
    - temperature in [ecma](https://regex101.com/r/Wrpp4x/2) and the original in [pcre](https://regex101.com/r/Ak5Joj/1)
    - inches https://regex101.com/r/92Bl59/2
    - feet https://regex101.com/r/xVnj9A/3
    - miles https://regex101.com/r/qAti0n/2
    - mph https://regex101.com/r/8AvYcc/1
* for converting regexes from pcre ðŸ§  => ecma:
	`npm install regex-translator; npx regex-translator -o -T ecma -F pcre -R "(Â° ?)?\d+(\.\d+)?+Â°?+ ?[fF]"`
* more units up for convertion at

    - [wiki/Category:Imperial_units](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Imperial_units)
* run `npm test` for unit test fun.
* fun fact: I'm not a frontend dev, I don't really know what I'm doing. Apologies.
