<h1>Test cases from the interwebs</h1>
<h2>Fractions with whitespace after mantissa</h2>
For example, a 2 x 6 is actually 1 1/2 in. x 5 1/2 in.<br>
This half inch (1/2 in) must not be converted to "1/5 cm".
<h2>Number ranges </h2>
The usual pattern is a year-to-year variability, with a short string of dry years of 5–10 in rainfall. (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles#Climate">source</a>)
Also it can reach top speeds of 52 to 74 mph.
<h2>Quotation marks are not inches.</h2>
The following span contains nothing but the word thousand, in numbers and in quotation marks:<br>
<span class="token string">"1000"</span><br>
The 1000 in quotation marks must not be replaced. <br>
<h2>Don't replace the number in the brackets</h2>
With a population of around 131,136 (and 233,034 in the Capital Region), it is the centre of Iceland's cultural, economic, and governmental activity, and is a popular tourist destination. (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reykjav%C3%ADk">source</a>)
<h2>"In" is an actual word, folks</h2>
DiCaprio, who has been famous for almost his entire life, has never dated a woman over the age of 25. Not when he was a teen heartthrob. Not when he was actually 25. And not now that he’s set to turn 48 in November. (<a href="https://www.pajiba.com/celebrities_are_better_than_you/the-under-25-elephant-in-leonardo-dicaprios-room.php">source</a>)
<h2>Yeah I don't even know what's happening here</h2>
For example, /(?<!-)\d+/ matches a number only if it is not preceded by a minus sign. (<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_Expressions/Cheatsheet">source</a>)

<h2>DOM manipulation check </h2>
<script language="javascript">
setTimeout(() => {
	var surpriseUpdateDiv = document.createElement('div');
	surpriseUpdateDiv.innerHTML = "If you see this text AND this temperature (90°F) <- <b>IN CELSIUS</b> then it means that the mutation observer test has worked.";
	document.body.appendChild(surpriseUpdateDiv);
	console.log("DOM manipulated.");
}, "1000");
